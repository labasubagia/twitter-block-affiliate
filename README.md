# X.com Block Keywords Extensions

## Background

X.com (also known as Twitter) is one of the most used social media in the world.

However, some content can be annoying for some people.

This content can be affiliate links, bad words, etc.

This extension was created to protect us from that tweet/post.

### Mute Word on X

![Twitter post](https://i.ibb.co/XVCSn3T/muted-word.png)

X.com actually already have a mute word feature, but it's still limited and cannot detect links (in case you want to block tweets that contain affiliate links).

This feature is limited to words, phrases, @username, and hashtags. In other words, this extension is the brutal version.
